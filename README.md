# E-commerce React js+ Vite 

This project is a modern e-commerce web application built with **React** and **Vite** to provide a fast and efficient development experience.

## Features

- Fast development with **Vite** and **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**
- React integration via official plugins:
  - [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) (uses Babel for fast refresh)
  - Support for [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) (uses SWC for faster compilation)
- Code quality ensured with **ESLint** and recommended rules
- Clean and maintainable JavaScript codebase

## Recommended Enhancements

For production-grade applications, consider using **TypeScript** along with `typescript-eslint` to enable type-aware linting rules. See [Vite React TS Template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for more details.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies  
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
